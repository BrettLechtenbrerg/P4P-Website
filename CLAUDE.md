## 🔐 Power Hub CMS (NEW in v2.0.0)

The Power Hub is an embedded content management system that allows non-technical users to edit website content without touching code.

### Access
- **URL:** https://p4p-website.vercel.app/power-hub
- **Username:** `p4padmin`
- **Password:** `p4p2026`
- **Hidden:** robots: noindex, nofollow (won't appear in search engines)

### Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Login** | Secure dark-themed login page |
| **Dashboard** | Quick actions, content file list with timestamps |
| **Content Editor** | Visual JSON editor for nested objects/arrays |
| **Deploy Button** | One-click git push triggers Vercel rebuild |
| **Settings** | Site info, quick links to live pages |

### How It Works
```
Site Owner → Login → Edit JSON content → Save → Deploy → Vercel auto-builds → Live site updates
```

### Content Files
Content is stored in `/content/*.json` files:
- `home.json` - Hero text, partner logos, stats
- `about.json` - Mission, values, focus areas

Components read from these JSON files:
```typescript
import homeContent from '@/content/home.json';
const { hero } = homeContent;
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Set in `.env.local` or Vercel dashboard:
```
PORTAL_USERNAME=p4padmin    # Default if not set
PORTAL_PASSWORD=p4p2026     # Default if not set
```

## Reference Site

This site was built to match the visual style of the **Murray Chamber of Commerce** website:

- **MACC Production:** https://macc-website-2.vercel.app/
- **MACC Reference:** https://web-seven-beta-31.vercel.app/
- **MACC GitHub:** https://github.com/BrettLechtenbrerg/MACC-Website
- **MACC Project:** `/Users/brettlechtenberg/Desktop/Claude Projects/MACC-Website/`

---

## Deployment Notes

**IMPORTANT:** Always deploy using Vercel CLI, not the dashboard upload:
```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

This avoids issues with standard uploads and ensures proper builds.
